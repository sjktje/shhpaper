  abstract = {The article offers information on the use of catheter ablation in treating atrial fibrillation. It says that pathoanatomical changes occur during atrial fibrillation are fibrosis and atrial muscle mass loss. It also mentions that catheter ablation has improved and is evolving as standard treatment option in which its techniques are centered on atrial tissue, areas related to autonomic tone, and electrical triggers. The care before, during, and after ablation management is also discussed.},

  abstract = {The Impact of Power Output During Percutaneous Catheter Radiofrequency Ablation Introduction Percutaneous catheter radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been widely used to treat patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Success rates are, however, variable and optimal levels of power used and duration of power delivery have not been fully established. Different ablation centers continue to use various power protocols. We undertook a comprehensive systematic review to evaluate the impact of power output during RFA for AF on efficacy and safety. Methods and results We systematically searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for studies on power output during percutaneous RFA for AF. The marked heterogeneous nature of the studies prohibited a meta-analysis. The main findings were (1) power output of ≤30 watts (W) has good safety profiles but low efficacy rates; (2) power output of \ensuremath{>}30 W-\ensuremath{<}45 W is safe with good efficacy; (3) power output of ≥ 45 W has a better efficacy profile but associated with a high risk of complications; (4) delivery of higher power of ≥ 45 W at shorter duration (15-20 seconds) is safe and efficacious; and (5) energy titration with visualization of microbubbles by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) has better efficacy and safety profiles compared to RFA without ICE. Conclusions Despite the overall reduced quality data relating power to outcomes of RFA for AF, the optimal power output showing good efficacy and safety profiles appears generically to be \ensuremath{>}30 W-\ensuremath{<}45 W, with significant variation in the literature.},

  abstract = {Heparin and coumarins have been the mainstay of anticoagulant therapy throughout our working lives. As we stand on the threshold of a new era of anticoagulants it is timely to look back upon their discovery and development. Both have fascinating stories to tell. Jay McLean claimed to have discovered heparin whilst a medical student, although this is disputed. The story of warfarin leads us from a mysterious haemorrhagic disease of cattle to the development of a rat poison which became one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in history. Many people were involved in both stories and we owe them all a debt of gratitude.},
